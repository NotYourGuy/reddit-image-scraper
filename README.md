> Subreddit image scraper made in Python

### üè† [Homepage](https://git.io/Jeun2)

## Pre-requisites
PRAW (https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is required for this script to run. To install it:
```sh 
$ pip3 install praw
```
Also, inside the ```praw.ini``` file you need to modify the access lines (as described [here](http://www.storybench.org/how-to-scrape-reddit-with-python/)). 

You may also add other accounts by keeping the same structure and changing the line in the ```scraperr.py``` file that matches the name of the code block (eg. ```reddit = praw.Reddit("scraperr")```)

```sh
[scraperr]
; this is your 14 character personal use script
client_id= 
; this is your 27 character secret
client_secret= 
; this is the name you gave your application
user_agent= 
; this is username for the reddit account the app was created with
username=  
; password for the account
password=
```

$ python3 scrapper.py -h
